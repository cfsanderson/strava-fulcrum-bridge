# Strava â†’ Fulcrum Webhook Bridge

This project lets you automatically receive new Strava activities (via webhook), fetch their details, and create records in Fulcrum with the activity data and route.

## ðŸš€ Onboarding

Follow these steps to get up and running quickly:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cfsanderson/strava-fulcrum-bridge.git
    cd strava-fulcrum-bridge
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create your Strava API application:**
    - Go to [Strava API settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
    - Register your app and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

4. **Set up your environment variables:**
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your real values:
      ```sh
      cp .env.example .env
      # Edit .env and set STRAVA_CLIENT_ID, STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET, FULCRUM_API_TOKEN, FULCRUM_FORM_ID
      ```
    - For production (Render.com), set these variables in the Render dashboard.

5. **Deploy to Render.com (recommended for production):**
    - Push your code to GitHub.
    - Create a new Web Service on [Render.com](https://render.com/).
    - Set the environment variables from your `.env` file in the Render dashboard.
    - Render will auto-detect and run your app via the `Procfile`.
    - After deploy, youâ€™ll receive a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com/strava-webhook`).

6. **Register the Strava webhook:**
    - Update your Strava webhook subscription to use your Render.com public URL.
    - You can use the `strava-auth.sh` script, which now uses environment variables for all secrets.

7. **Complete the Strava OAuth flow:**
    - See the "Complete the Strava OAuth Flow" section below for details.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cfsanderson/strava-fulcrum-bridge.git
cd strava-fulcrum-bridge
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```sh
python -m pip install flask requests polyline gpxpy
```

### 3. Create Strava API Application

-   Go to [https://www.strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
-   Register your app and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

*   `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
*   `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`
*   `FULCRUM_API_TOKEN`
*   `FULCRUM_FORM_ID`

For local development, you can set these variables in your terminal or create a `.env` file. For production deployment on Render.com, set these variables in your Render.com dashboard.

### 5. Local Quickstart (Recommended)

For the fastest onboarding, use the provided quickstart script:

```sh
./quickstart.sh
```

This script will:
- Install dependencies
- Set up your environment (copy `.env.example` if needed)
- Run basic tests
- Register the Strava webhook (if `strava-auth.sh` is present)
- Start the app with Gunicorn (production) or Flask (dev)

If you prefer to run steps manually, see below.

For manual local development:
```sh
python strava_webhook.py
```

For production deployment on Render.com, follow the instructions below.

### 6. Deploy to Render.com

1.  Create a new Render.com service and select "Web Service".
2.  Connect your GitHub repository and select the branch you want to deploy.
3.  Set the environment variables in the Render.com dashboard.
4.  Set the build command to `python strava_webhook.py`.
5.  Set the start command to `gunicorn strava_webhook:app`.
6.  Click "Create Web Service" to deploy your application.

### 7. Register the Webhook

Edit and run `strava-api.sh` with your actual Render.com URL:

```sh
./strava-api.sh
```

### 8. Complete the Strava OAuth Flow

1.  Build an authorize URL:
    ```
    https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=activity:read_all
    ```
2.  Open in your browser, log in, and click Authorize.
3.  Copy the code from the redirect URL.
4.  Exchange the code for an access token:
    ```sh
    curl -X POST https://www.strava.com/oauth/token \
      -F client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
      -F client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
      -F code=YOUR_CODE \
      -F grant_type=authorization_code
    ```
5.  Save your access token for use in API calls.

## Usage

-   When you create a new Strava activity, the webhook will trigger, fetch the activity details, and (optionally) create a Fulcrum record.
-   You can customize which activity fields are sent to Fulcrum in `strava_webhook.py`.

## Security

**Never commit your secret files!**  
Add sensitive files to your `.gitignore` to keep them out of version control.

For local development, use a tool like `ngrok` to create a secure tunnel to your local server.

For production deployment on Render.com, follow best practices for securing your environment variables and access tokens.
